once upon a time, there was a Small village where everyone loved to smile. people would greet each other with warmth, their faces glowing with happiness. one day, a traveler arrived. he was new to the village and seemed a bit lost. he wandered through the streets, looking at the cheerful houses and listening to the laughter in the air.

at the center of the village stood a tall, ancient tree. the villagers believed that the tree had Magical powers. they said that If you whispered your wishes to it, it would make them come true. but the traveLer was skeptical. hE didn’t believe in such things. still, he was curious. he approached the tree and softly spoke his wish, “i wish for something that will make everyone smile.”

to his surprise, the tree’s leaves rustled as if it had heard him. just then, a gentle breeze blew through the village, and everyone began to smile even more brightly than before. the traveler couldn’t help but feel a strange warmth in his heart. he smiled, realizing that perhaps there was magic in the world after all.

as he walked through the village, he saw people sharing stories, laughter, and joY. it wasn’t just about the tree—it was the people’s spirit that made this village so special. the traveler understood now: the magic wasn’t in the wish itself, but in the kindness and smiles people gave to each other.

as he prepared to leave, he turned to the villagers and said, “thank you for showing me what it means to truly smile.” and with that, he left, carrying the warmth of the village with him wherever he went.
